PyRubberband
============

A python wrapper for `rubberband <http://breakfastquay.com/rubberband/>`_.

For now, this just provides lightweight wrappers for pitch-shifting and time-stretching.

All processing is done via the command-line through files on disk.  In the future, this could be improved
by directly wrapping the C library instead.

Example usage
-------------
.. code-block:: python

    >>> import soundfile as sf
    >>> import pyrubberband as pyrb
    >>> y, sr = sf.read("myfile.wav")
    >>> # Play back at double speed
    >>> y_stretch = pyrb.time_stretch(y, sr, 2.0)
    >>> # Play back two semi-tones higher
    >>> y_shift = pyrb.pitch_shift(y, sr, 2)
